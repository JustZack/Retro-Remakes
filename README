This repository is a place for me to drop remakes/rebuilds of very old games that are trivial to build now.

So far I have built:
    Snake (CLI)

I'd like to build:
    Snake (GFX)
    Pong (CLI/GFX)
    Space Invaders (CLI/GFX) 
    Tetris (CLI/GFX)  

For Tetris, Space Invaders, and PONG I want to use a console 'graphics' library which i will write myself for fun and function.
